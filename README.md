## Geospatial data analytics: Affects of community gardens on housing prices in New York City.

### Basic Information:
This project aims to discover how “Greenthumb community gardens” areas in a neighborhood affect housing prices and rental rates in New York City. 

### Datasets
Two datasets have been used in this project: <br>

<b>(1) DOF: Condominium comparable rental income – Manhattan - FY 2010/2011: </b> <br>
The Department of Finance (DOF) is required by NY State law to value condominiums or cooperatives as if they were residential rental apartment buildings. DOF uses income information from rental properties similar in physical features and location to the condominiums or cooperatives. DOF applies this income data to the condominium or cooperative and determine its value in the same way DOF values rental apartment buildings.<br>
